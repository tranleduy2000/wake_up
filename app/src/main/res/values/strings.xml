    <string name="lock_admin_rights_explanation"><b>Lock device: Device Administrator</b>\n\nIn order to lock the screen, we need to set WaveUp as a Device Administrator.\n\nOnce an app is a Device Administrator, you won\'t be able to uninstall it normally without revoking the Device Admin Permission.\n\nIf you wish to revoke the Device Admin Permission, just open WaveUp, go to the advanced options (upper right corner) and tap on \'Revoke Device Admin Permission\'. Alternatively you can go to <i>Settings → Security → Device Administrators</i> and uncheck WaveUp.\n\nIf you wish to uninstall WaveUp just tap on the \'Uninstall WaveUp\' button at the bottom of the app which revokes the Device Admin Privilege <i>and</i> directly uninstalls WaveUp.\n\nAre you sure you want to set WaveUp as Device Administrator?</string>
