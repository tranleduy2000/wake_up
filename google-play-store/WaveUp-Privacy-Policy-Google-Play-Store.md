## Data collected by me

I, that is, the app developer, do not collect any personal information whatsoever.

## Data collected by Google Play

Google Inc. provides the developer, i.e. me, with anonymised user data (aggregate data) through the Google Play Developer Console.

If you review the app Google Inc. will additionally provide information about your device (Device, Manufacturer, Device type, Device language, CPU make, CPU model, Native platform, RAM (MB), Screen size, Screen density (dpi), OpenGL ES version and OS).

## Why does WaveUp request 'Phone' permissions? Will WaveUp 'make and manage phone calls'?

No. WaveUp will never make or manage phone calls. It also never knows with whom you speak on the phone. It uses this permission exclusively to know whether there is an ongoing call in order to deactivate itself during the call. No information related to the call is queried nor stored. Also the fact that there is an ongoing call is only known by the WaveUp app and is never sent elsewhere.
