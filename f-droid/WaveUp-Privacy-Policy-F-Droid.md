## Why does WaveUp request 'Phone' permissions? Will WaveUp 'make and manage phone calls'?

No. WaveUp will never make or manage phone calls. It also never knows with whom you speak on the phone. It uses this permission exclusively to know whether there is an ongoing call in order to deactivate itself during the call. No information related to the call is queried nor stored. Also the fact that there is an ongoing call is only known by the WaveUp app and is never sent elsewhere.
